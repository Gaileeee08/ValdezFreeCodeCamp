            <p> Sometimes, there are dreams and aspirations you wish you could have pursued, but I understand how difficult it can be to fight for 
                what you love when you come from a dysfunctional family. 
                The impact of that environment often makes it hard to function and thrive. 
                You may look back and think about all the things you could have done better if not for those struggles. 
                <!--I wrote this about myself cause I had a long way to go, still fixing mysel from a dysfunctional family for 23 years of my life, It's not easy 
                as it seems, I know ther are a lot of things to learn independently, but atleast I am safe now in where I am now. -->
